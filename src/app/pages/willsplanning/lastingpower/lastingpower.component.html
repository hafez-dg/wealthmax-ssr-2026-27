    Why Set Up a Lasting Power of Attorney?
  </h3>
  <p class="text-Size text-justify text-md-center">
    At WealthMax, we understand the importance of planning for the unexpected.
    According to government statistics, around 100,000 people experience strokes
    each year, and this is just one of the many ways in which you might become
    incapacitated. Without a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) in place, your
    loved ones may have a great deal of difficulty in managing your affairs,
    making critical medical decisions or accessing bank accounts. Our LPA
    services allow you to appoint trusted individuals to act on your behalf,
    making sure your affairs are handled smoothly during difficult times.

    <p class="text-Size text-justify text-md-center mb-3 mb-lg-5">
      In the event that you lose your ability to make decisions for yourself due
      to illness or injury, your LPA will become triggered. Your appointed
      person will be able to make meaningful calls about aspects of your life,

            An LPA ensures that someone you trust can make decisions on your
            behalf if you become unable to do so, whether due to illness,
            accident, or age-related conditions.

            With a Health and Welfare LPA, your attorney can make decisions

            live, based on your wishes.

            Without an LPA, loved ones may need to apply to the Court of

            time-consuming, expensive, and emotionally draining.
