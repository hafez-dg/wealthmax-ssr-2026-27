    <h3 class="heading-txt mb-3 text-center">Why Trust Planning Matters?</h3>
    <p class="text-Size text-justify text-md-center">
      Around 60% of UK people die intestate, which can make things very
      complicated for your beneficiaries when it comes to distributing your
      property or assets as you wish. However, when WealthMax assists you in
      setting up a trust, you can avoid the delays and increased costs that
      occur when adequate inheritance tax planning isn’t carried out.  When
      trusts are established, they not only provide clear instructions regarding
      who receives your assets or property but also how they’re passed on. For
      example, without a trust, the beneficiary may simply receive a lump sum,
      which can lead to irresponsible spending and disputes among family
      members. Our experts can help you in setting up a trust in which trustees
      hold your assets for the benefit of your heirs. They offer a flexible way
      to transfer your assets while retaining control over how they're
      distributed. This also protects your assets from creditors and inheritance
      tax by reducing the overall size of your estate. Trusts are subject to
      legal and tax rules that may change. Tax treatment depends on individual
      circumstances. Professional advice is recommended to ensure suitability.
