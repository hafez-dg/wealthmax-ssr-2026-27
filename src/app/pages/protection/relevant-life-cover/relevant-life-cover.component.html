  <h3 class="heading-txt mb-3 text-center">Why have Relevant Life Cover?</h3>
  <p class="text-Size text-justify text-lg-center">
    Relevant life policies are a form of employer-funded life cover that
    provides a 'death-in-service' style benefit to eligible employees. These
    policies are taken out by the business on the life of an individual employee
    and are typically written into trust, ensuring that any payout is made
    directly to the employee’s nominated beneficiaries. Importantly, the benefit
    cannot be paid to the company.
  </p>

  <p class="text-Size text-justify text-lg-center">
    At Wealthmax Financial Advisers Limited, we can help you set up relevant
    life cover tailored to your business needs. A payout is triggered if the
    insured employee dies or is diagnosed with a terminal illness during the
    term of the policy. Premiums paid by the employer are generally considered
    an allowable expense for Corporation Tax purposes. From the employee’s
    perspective, there is no income tax liability on the premiums, as they are
    not treated as a benefit in kind. Additionally, for most individuals, any
    payout from the policy will be free from income tax and inheritance tax,
    subject to current HMRC rules and the correct trust structure being in
    place.
