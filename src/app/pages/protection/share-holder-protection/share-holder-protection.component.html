    Why have Shareholder Protection Cover?
  </h3>
  <p class="text-Size text-justify text-lg-center">
    There’s a common misconception that shareholder protection and directors’
    insurance are the same. In reality, they are distinctly different forms of
    business cover. Shareholder protection is designed to safeguard business
    owners in the event of a shareholder’s death or diagnosis of a critical
    illness, whereas directors’ insurance typically relates to indemnity or
    liability risks associated with a director’s role.
  </p>

  <p class="text-Size text-justify text-lg-center">
    Shareholder protection is also often confused with key person insurance.
    While both aim to mitigate financial risks, they serve different purposes.
    Key person insurance helps protect the business against the loss of a vital
    individual whose absence could affect profitability. In contrast,
    shareholder protection specifically addresses ownership continuity—ensuring
    that if a shareholder exits due to death or illness, the remaining owners
    can retain control and minimise disruption to the business.

            A Market for the Shares When structured correctly, shareholder
            protection creates a market for shares in private companies that are
            too small to be listed on a recognised exchange. The policy provides
            the funds needed for a smooth transfer of ownership between existing
            shareholders.
