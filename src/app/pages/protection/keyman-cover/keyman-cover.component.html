    <h3 class="heading-txt mb-3 text-center">Why have Key Person Insurance</h3>
    <p class="text-Size text-justify text-lg-center">
      Most companies insure their buildings and physical assets against risks
      such as fire, flood, theft and equipment breakdown. However, they often
      overlook their most valuable asset: the key individuals at the top of the
      organisation who drive critical business functions. Without these people,
      the business could face serious disruption—and in some cases, may struggle
      to survive.

      What are the Benefits of Key Person Protection Cover?
    </h3>
    <p class="text-Size text-justify text-lg-center">
      A question we're often asked is, “Why is key person insurance important?”
      Recent research shows that more than half of businesses would cease
      trading within 12 months if a key employee were to pass away or become
      critically ill. That alone is a compelling reason to consider this type of
      cover.
